# Pygame-Atari-Pong

## I found the code file in an old pendrive for a project I made during summer break in 10th Grade for the "Intro to Python" topic for the Computer Science Subject I took as a High School Sophomore.

## I wished to save the file as memory as well as a history of how early on I began my coding journey.

## The idea to recreate the old school pong game by Atari is my own *but is based on a course i paid for during the summer break.*
